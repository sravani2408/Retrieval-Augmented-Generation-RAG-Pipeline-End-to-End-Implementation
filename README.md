Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipeline — End-to-End Implementation

This project delivers a complete, production-oriented Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflow designed to convert unstructured enterprise documents into machine-usable knowledge and leverage that knowledge to generate accurate, context-grounded responses with a Large Language Model (LLM).

The implementation demonstrates the full lifecycle of a modern RAG system—from ingestion to retrieval to generation—using proven architectural patterns and modular components suitable for real-world deployment.

What This Project Does?

This repository implements a RAG pipeline that:
1. Ingests raw documents (PDFs, text files, and other unstructured sources).
2. Automatically parses and normalizes content using loaders designed for enterprise-scale documents.
3. Splits documents into semantically meaningful chunks using recursive text chunking to preserve context.
4. Generates dense embeddings using a transformer encoder for each chunk.
5. Indexes embeddings in a FAISS vector store optimized for similarity search.
6. Retrieves relevant chunks based on user queries through vector similarity search.
7. Constructs contextual prompts that merge retrieved evidence with query intent.
8. Produces grounded LLM answers that reference retrieved knowledge rather than relying on hallucination.

Each step is implemented to reflect real production expectations: modular design, reusable components, metadata tracking, and deterministic pipeline behavior.
